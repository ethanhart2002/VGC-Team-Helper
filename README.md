# VGC-Team-Helper


## Description
This is the open source code for VGC Team Helper, a project that aims to help players build VGC teams with recommendations based on a provided Pokepaste. At a high level, this project does the following:
1. Takes in a Pokepaste link and decodes the entire Pokemon team.
2. Analyzes the Pokemon team for cores, modes, support moves, and coverage moves, all while scoring each aspect. 
3. Returns the score and analysis to the user.


For more information on cores, modes, support moves, and coverage moves, visit [VGC Guide](https://www.vgcguide.com/)
